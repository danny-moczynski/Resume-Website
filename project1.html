            <p>This was a lab I needed to complete in the second semester of my sophomore year in Object Oriented Programming ll. The goal of this lab was to find the most efficient and least efficient ways to use an arraylist and linked list. Furthermore, this lab returned the efficiency of a deque list. Also this lab read in a file being alice in wonderland, and returned the total number of words and unique words. As well as being able to find any word and return the number of any word inputted by the user.</p>
