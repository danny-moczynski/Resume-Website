            <h1>This program creates an app for scheduling cohorts for clinical students at UW Oshkosh who are in the nursing program.</h1>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/jordynhenrich13/ClinicalCoordinationApplication.git" target="_blank">Source code</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>This application was created because the nursing program was very unorganized since all of their book keeping was done on paper and excel spreadsheets. The students would have to email or go to their professors to see when their clinicals are for their cohort. This app allows for students to see when their clinicals are through the app, making it much for efficient for the student and clinical coordinator. </p>
